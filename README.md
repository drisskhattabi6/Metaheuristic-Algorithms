### Genetic Algorithm (GA)

A Genetic Algorithm is a search heuristic inspired by the process of natural selection that belongs to the larger class of evolutionary algorithms (EA). It is used to generate solutions to optimization and search problems.

### Tabu Search

Tabu Search is a metaheuristic search method employing local search techniques and using memory structures to avoid cycles and ensure exploration of new areas in the search space.

### Simulated Annealing (SA)

Simulated Annealing is a probabilistic technique for approximating the global optimum of a given function. It is inspired by the annealing process in metallurgy.

### Iterated Local Search (ILS)

Iterated Local Search is an optimization algorithm that iteratively applies a local search to modified versions of the best solutions found so far.

### Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO)

Grey Wolf Optimization is a nature-inspired metaheuristic algorithm based on the social hierarchy and hunting behavior of grey wolves.

### Flower Pollination Algorithm (FPA)

The Flower Pollination Algorithm (FPA) is a nature-inspired optimization algorithm based on the pollination process of flowering plants. It mimics the behavior of flowers and pollinators to solve optimization problems.

### Shuffled Frog-Leaping Algorithm (SFLA)

The Shuffled Frog-Leaping Algorithm (SFLA) is a memetic metaheuristic optimization algorithm inspired by the social behavior of frogs in finding food. It combines the benefits of both local search and global information exchange.

### Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)

Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is a population-based optimization algorithm inspired by the social behavior of birds flocking or fish schooling. It optimizes a problem by iteratively improving candidate solutions based on their own experiences and those of their neighbors.

### Ant Colony Optimization (ACO)

Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) is a probabilistic technique inspired by the foraging behavior of ants. It is used for solving combinatorial optimization problems by simulating the pheromone trail laying and following behavior of ants.
