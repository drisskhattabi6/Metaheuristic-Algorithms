### Defination :

The Flower Pollination Algorithm (FPA) is a nature-inspired optimization algorithm based on the pollination process of flowering plants. Introduced by Xin-She Yang in 2012, the FPA is designed to solve complex optimization problems by mimicking the natural behavior of pollination. Here’s an overview of the key concepts and mechanics of the Flower Pollination Algorithm:

### Key Concepts

1. **Pollination Process**: 
   - **Biotic and Abiotic Pollination**: Biotic pollination involves living organisms (like bees) transferring pollen, while abiotic pollination relies on non-living processes (like wind and water).
   - **Cross-Pollination and Self-Pollination**: Cross-pollination occurs between flowers of different plants, leading to greater diversity, whereas self-pollination occurs within the same flower or between flowers of the same plant.

2. **Lévy Flights**: 
   - Lévy flights are a type of random walk with step lengths following a heavy-tailed probability distribution, enabling long jumps in the search space. This helps in exploring new regions and avoiding local optima. They are characterized by:

    1. **Heavy-Tailed Distribution**:
        - Step lengths follow a power-law distribution: \( P(l) \sim l^{-\mu} \), with \( 1 < \mu \leq 3 \). Typically, \( \mu \) is 1.5.

    2. **Scale-Invariance**:
        - The statistical properties of step lengths remain consistent across different scales.

    #### Calculating Lévy Flights

    To implement Lévy flights:

    1. **Generate Random Variables**:
        - Generate two independent random variables \( u \) and \( v \) from a normal distribution \( N(0, 1) \).

    2. **Calculate Step Size**:
        - Use Mantegna's algorithm:
        \[
        L = \frac{u}{|v|^{1/\beta}}
        \]
        where \( \beta \) is usually 1.5.

    #### Pseudo-Code for Generating Lévy Flights

    Here’s how you can generate Lévy flights in pseudo-code:

    ```pseudo
    function LévyFlight(beta):
        # Generate random variables u and v
        u = RandomNormal(0, 1)
        v = RandomNormal(0, 1)

        # Calculate step size L using Mantegna's algorithm
        sigma_u = (Gamma(1 + beta) * sin(π * beta / 2) / (Gamma((1 + beta) / 2) * beta * 2^((beta - 1) / 2)))^(1 / beta)
        step_length = u * sigma_u / (abs(v)^(1 / beta))

        return step_length
    ```


### Mechanics of FPA

The algorithm can be summarized in the following steps:

1. **Initialization**:
   - Define the objective function to be optimized.
   - Initialize a population of solutions (flowers), each with a random position in the solution space.

2. **Global Pollination (Cross-Pollination)**:
   - For each flower, apply a global pollination process where the new position is influenced by the best solution found so far.
   - This step uses Lévy flights to model the long-distance movement of pollinators:
     \[
     x_i^{t+1} = x_i^t + L \cdot (g^t - x_i^t)
     \]
     where \( x_i^{t+1} \) is the new position, \( x_i^t \) is the current position, \( g^t \) is the global best solution, and \( L \) is a step size drawn from a Lévy distribution.

3. **Local Pollination (Self-Pollination)**:
   - Apply local pollination to each flower, mimicking self-pollination or local pollination:
     \[
     x_i^{t+1} = x_i^t + \epsilon (x_j^t - x_k^t)
     \]
     where \( x_j^t \) and \( x_k^t \) are different flowers chosen randomly from the population, and \( \epsilon \) is a random number drawn from a uniform distribution.

4. **Switching Probability**:
   - A probability \( p \) determines whether a flower undergoes global or local pollination. Typically, \( p \) is set to a small value, encouraging a balance between exploration and exploitation.

5. **Update**:
   - Evaluate the new solutions. If a new solution is better, update the flower’s position.
   - Update the global best solution if a new best is found.

6. **Termination**:
   - Repeat the process until a stopping criterion is met, such as a maximum number of iterations or a satisfactory objective value.

### Flower Pollination Algorithm (FPA) Pseudo-Code

```pseudo
Initialize parameters: population size (n), switching probability (p), maximum iterations (MaxGen)
Initialize a population of n flowers with random positions
Evaluate the fitness of each flower

Find the current best solution (g_best)

While (t < MaxGen):
    For each flower i in the population:
        Generate a random number rand in [0, 1]
        
        If rand < p:
            # Global pollination via Lévy flights
            Draw a step size L from Lévy distribution
            Update flower position using: 
            x_i = x_i + L * (g_best - x_i)
        Else:
            # Local pollination
            Randomly select two flowers x_j and x_k from the population
            Generate a random number ε in [0, 1]
            Update flower position using:
            x_i = x_i + ε * (x_j - x_k)
        
        Evaluate the fitness of the new position
        If new position is better, update the flower's position
    
    Update g_best if a better solution is found
    Increment iteration counter t

Return the best solution found (g_best)
```
